# 🔎 Face Recognition

A lightweight Python project to capture, train, and recognize faces using OpenCV.  
Perfect for learning the basics of computer vision and real-time recognition.

---

## ⚡ Features
- 📸 Capture face images directly from webcam  
- 🧠 Train a recognition model on your dataset  
- 🎥 Run live detection & recognition in real time  
- 🛠️ Modular structure (capture / model / live detection)  

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arshavant/face-recognition.git
cd face-recognition
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy
````
---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script and choose an option:

```bash
python main.py
```

Options:

* **c** → Capture images
* **t** → Train model
* **l** → Live detection
* **q** → Quit
